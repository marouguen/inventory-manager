Perfect. Here's the clean and safe way to do what you want:

---

## ‚úÖ GOAL

You want to:

1. Keep your **later commits** (after `38f6661`) in a **separate branch**.
2. Restore the **main branch** to the state of commit `38f6661` so you can work freely from there.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a backup branch to preserve all current work:

```bash
git checkout -b temp-backup-branch
```

This moves you to a new branch with all your current work (latest commits included).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Switch back to `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reset `main` to the desired older commit (safe now because your work is backed up):

```bash
git reset --hard 38f6661
```

Now, your `main` branch is clean and exactly as it was in commit `38f6661`.

---

### ‚úÖ RESULT

| Branch               | State                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `main`               | At commit `38f6661`, ready for fresh work |
| `temp-backup-branch` | All commits after `38f6661`, nothing lost |

---

## üß† Optional: Rename `temp-backup-branch` if needed

If you plan to keep working on those later commits:

```bash
git branch -m feature-later-commits
```

---

Let me know if you want to merge them later or cherry-pick specific features from that branch.
